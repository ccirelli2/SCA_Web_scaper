### PURPOSE:
'''
The Purpose of this script is to house the documentation for all of the scripts and modules associated with this project. 





### AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT_________________________________________________________________


MYSQL SCA_data TABLE----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) Null Values:        The insert statements need to be corrected to remove arbitary entries
                        for when a datapoint cannot be scraped and insert a Null value. 
                        This way we will have a uniform way of identifying those values. 


MODULES & SCRIPTS-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) Naming Convention:  We need to better name our scripts to accurately reflect their purpose
                        and functions. 


2.) Script_8_ML_Driver / Module_8_Machine_Learning_Functions:

    i.) Class Duration:     This derived value should be built into the SQL scheme as a 
                            trigger to be executed upon every insert or update statement. 

    ii.) SQL Table:         The SQL table schema should be updated to reflect all of 
                            these changes that we are making.  For instance, any additional 
                            derived values or values we are chosing to drop that no longer 
                            are needed.
